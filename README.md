# BGP-LLaMA: fine-tuning open-source LLM on BGP routing knowledge and analysis
We present the first open-source LLM specialized in the BGP routing analytics- BGP-LLaMA, instruction-tuned LLaMA-13B model. We built BGP-LLaMA by fine-tuning LLaMA with our own BGP training data that were collected from Internet standard documents or papers, and generated by self-instruction of OpenAIâ€™s Chat-GPT. BGP-LLaMA can answer to BGP routing questions and can automate manual BGP analysis tasks of BGP routing data.
